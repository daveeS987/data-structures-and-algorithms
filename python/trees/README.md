### Binary Tree

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

- pre order
- in order
- post order

Any exceptions or errors should be semantic, capture-able errors.

### Binary Search Tree

Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

Add

- Arguments: value
- Return: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

Contains

- Argument: value
- Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
